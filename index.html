        <a>Why is my password not working?</a>
        <div class="content">
          <p>If you've forgotten your password, please reach out to Sysop (Ext. 351 - sysop@rogers-brown.com) and mention if you're trying to log on to the production system or training system. Please note that your password has a pre-determined expiration date as an added security measure. The CargoWise application should alert you when your password is set to expire and allow you to create a new one.</p>

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <a>I used to get a specific report from the AS/400. Why don't I get that same report on CargoWise?</a>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Most reports have been replicated in the CargoWise system. If you still don't see one that you believe you should be recieving, reach out to sysop so they can investigate. Please note that not every report from the 400 is able to be replicated in CW as sysop does not have complete access to the system like the 400.</p>
